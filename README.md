# Kindly
An app to connect with people and lend a hand in your community.

This app is a platform for both giving and receiving help within the community. Inspired by the saying, "No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted" we recognize that every gesture of goodwill can make a difference. Our app embodies the spirit of community and compassion, operating on a "give what you can" basis. 

Beneficiaries are encouraged to tip volunteers according to their means, ensuring that services are accessible to all and that generosity is appreciated.
By fostering a culture of mutual support, our app creates a network of care that brings people together, helping to meet needs and build stronger, more connected communities.
